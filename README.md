# Real Time Bus Tracker

### Description
This project currently tracks all the buses on route 1 as per the MBTA API. Locations are updated every 15 seconds.

### How to Run
Currently is not built to be hosted. Simply open the index.html file locally with your browser.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
Potentially may allow for user interaction to select buses and trains and pull down respective data for the selection. Would also like to add custom icons for bus and train markers.

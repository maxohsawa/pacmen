# Pacmen

### Description
This project demonstrates the use of user interaction via button inputs, the manipulation of the DOM to create objects via JavaScript, and some rudimentary collision detection. It currently adds a Pacman with each press of the add button and then begins the animation with the start button.

### How to Run
Currently is not built to be hosted. Simply open the index.html file locally with your browser or visit the [demo](https://maxohsawa.github.io/pacmen).

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
Potentially may add animations for pacmen to have moving mouths, may add food to the window for the pacmen to interact with.
